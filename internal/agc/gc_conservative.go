package agc

// This memory manager is a textbook mark/sweep implementation, heavily inspired
// by the MicroPython garbage collector.
//
// The memory manager internally uses blocks of 4 pointers big (see
// bytesPerBlock). Every allocation first rounds up to this size to align every
// block. It will first try to find a chain of blocks that is big enough to
// satisfy the allocation. If it finds one, it marks the first one as the "head"
// and the following ones (if any) as the "tail" (see below). If it cannot find
// any free space, it will perform a garbage collection cycle and try again. If
// it still cannot find any free space, it gives up.
//
// Every block has some metadata, which is stored at the end of the heap.
// The four states are "free", "head", "tail", and "mark". During normal
// operation, there are no marked blocks. Every allocated object starts with a
// "head" and is followed by "tail" blocks. The reason for this distinction is
// that this way, the start and end of every object can be found easily.
//
// Metadata is stored in a special area at the end of the heap, in the area
// metadataStart..heapEnd. The actual blocks are stored in
// heapStart..metadataStart.
